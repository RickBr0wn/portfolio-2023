My name is Rick Brown and I am a self-taught web developer. I have always been passionate about technology and programming, and decided to teach myself how to code.
After many hours of hard work and dedication, I am now comfortable in Javascript/Typescript, React, Next.js, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS, and a wide variety of packages associated with the React/Javascript eco-system. I also enjoy using Unity (C#), and of course Leetcode. All together this makes me feel ready to take on my first job in the tech industry.
I am a quick learner and a team player, with a strong work ethic and a determination to succeed. I am excited to bring my skills and experience to a dynamic and innovative company, where I can continue to learn and grow as a developer.
Thank you for taking the time to visit my blog/website. I hope you enjoy reading about my journey as a self-taught developer, and please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or opportunities.
